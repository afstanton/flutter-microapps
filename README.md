# flutter-microapps

This is a series of tiny apps in Flutter, each to educate myself about one small piece of functionality that I can use to eventually build larger apps. There are plenty of tutorials and demo apps out there, but I learn better by doing. I'll certainly try to learn better coding practices over time, but this is really basic stuff at the moment.

If you find any of these useful somehow, I'm putting this mess under the MIT license.

# Note

While an effort is being made to make these as cross platform as possible, certain pieces of functionality are not fully cross platform. Also, I have not thoroughly tested every piece on every platform. Priority is being given to MacOS and Chrome.
